#
# Rez configuration settings. Do not change this file.
#
# Settings are determined in the following way:
# 1) The setting is first read from this file;
# 2) The setting is then overridden if it is present in another settings file pointed at
#    by the $REZ_SETTINGS_FILE environment variable;
# 3) The setting is further overriden if it is present in $HOME/.rezconfig;
# 4) The setting is overridden again if the environment variable $REZ_XXX is present, where XXX
#    is the uppercase version of the setting key. For example, 'image_viewer' will be overriden
#    by $REZ_IMAGE_VIEWER.
#
# If a setting type is a list, then an overriding env-var is expected to be separated by the
# path seperator for the current os (eg ':' in Linux), unless overridden in the '_sep' section.
#
# There are a set of special variables that will expand at runtime. These can be referred to
# by any string-based setting, using the format '{varname}'. The available variables are:
# {root_dir} - Rez installation directory;
# {platform} - machine platform, eg 'linux';
# {arch} - machine architecture, eg 'x86_64';
# {os} - machine operating system, eg 'Ubuntu-12.04'.
# {shell} - current shell, eg 'bash'.
